    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1.) I am working towards on getting good grades. Everything led me to here. There are many reasons I want to get better grades and need better grades.

2.) I am working towards these goals by turning in my assignments on time and doing them instead of giving up because I feel its to hard and impossible. And by asking for help without getting scared.

3.)  Values I consider most necessary for my success is responsibility , consistency and integrity. 

4.) Short-term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future, are complete assignments in my spare time, and increase my average grade I get. 

5.) The character traits and achievements I most want to be known for is empathetic and understanding.
